# Discription
  The proposed device could assist mountaineering guides in immediately and effectively
managing their teams and facilitate improving safety in mountaineering by such IOT based
device. The main objective of this project is to track the location and health condition of
Mountain Climber throughout the trekking. Successfully studied the components and planning
to build a prototype also the device enables and guides to accurately monitor the physiological
status of a mountain climber and to make punctual commands, thereby providing guides with
an immediate and effective route for assistance.

  This project allows to track vitals of climbers in real time as well as monitor their
location over IOT. This provides the live Heartbeat monitoring, GPS Location Tracking,
Altimeter, Fall detection and Barometer sensor to sense the condition of a mountaineer,
monitoring them and transmitting this over the IOT for live monitoring in a form of SMS to
mountaineers configured/saved contact number's device.
