# Description

  This project allows to track vitals of climbers in real time as well as monitor their
location over IOT. This provides the live Heartbeat monitoring, GPS Location Tracking,
Altimeter, Fall detection and Barometer sensor to sense the condition of a mountaineer,
monitoring them and transmitting this over the IOT for live monitoring in a form of SMS to
mountaineers configured/saved contact number's device.

Technologies Used :- IOT, Arduino IDE, C++,Sensor Intigration.

# Paper Published in STM Journal of Communication Engineering & Systems(2023)

The project featured in the STM Journals Journal of Communication Engineering & Systems presents a health and GPS tracking device designed for mountain climbers. ISSN 2249-8613 highlights the utilization of the device to monitor climbers well-being and track their
locations using GPS technology along with the fall detection feature.
